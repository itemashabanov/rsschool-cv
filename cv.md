# CV by Artem Shabanov
## _üöÄJunior frontend developer_

##### Hi. My name is Artem Shabanov, a.k.a. Artsiom Shabanau _( as in the passport )_.

The main thing I do now at my job is the development of new functionality and layout. Due to the nature of the business, I make this functionality for a specific CMS, using its API, so these solutions are not entirely applicable from the outside, but they give a general idea of the work of algorithms and the sequence of actions for solving such problems. I'm going to remake one project in the near future from just a bunch of HTML pages to Node.js + Vue.js.

My straights are a sense of humor, the ability to manage working time, sociability, I'm always responsible for words, hard-working _( but sometimes I can say it's a weakness )_. Fast-learner, able to work independently, quality-oriented.

Now I have 2 lessons per week for English and my level is between __B1__ and __B2__ by course program. By the way, I study Lithuanian, also 2 times a week.

## üìàExpirience

I work for a company that sells cash registers and all that I do is the creation of new functionality, pages layout, maintenance of modules, refactoring of old code. I work here since 2019.
In-text above I wrote, that I ended the Vue course, and it's a [repo with its source code](https://github.com/itemashabanov/vue-20210304_itemashabanov).

You can also look at the process of creating an online store of my company on Vue.js [here](https://github.com/itemashabanov/spb-kassa).
